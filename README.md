## Key Features
- Blazingly fast realtime application finding
- Inline application argument launching using tab
    - Begin by typing an application name, hit TAB_KEY to lock it in, begin typing arguments to that application *(ie. "mail" TAB_KEY "someone@someplace.com" ENTER_KEY)*.
- Customizable UI and theme using CSS
- Intuitive Web/Desktop Integration
    - Just type what you're looking for, the application will determine whether or not an application should be launched or if the context requires an online web search.
- Direct command invocation
    - Utilize terminal commands directly by typing the executable name *(ie. "gedit" ENTER_KEY)*.
- Supports tab autocomplete for local application and filenames
- Supports CONTROL_KEY + ENTER_KEY for domain name completion *(ie. google => www.google.com, google.com => www.google.com, www.google => www.google.com)*.

## Customizable Settings <a name="customizable-settings"></a>
Application settings can be controlled using xfconf-query.

Available settings:
- /file-extension - defaults to ".desktop", controls the filenames to use for parsing.
- /web-search - defaults to "https://www.google.com/#safe=on&q=%s", controls the url format to use when applying a web search, %s is replaced by the query to be used.
- /theme = defaults to "default", controls the CSS file to use for the application *(Default location is: ~/.config/xfce4/finder/default.css)*.
- /application-directories - defaults to /usr/share/applications and ~/.local/share/applications, specifies the directories in which to look for application files with matching /file-extension.

List all available settings:

    xfconf-query -c xfce4-finder -l

List a setting:

    xfconf-query -c xfce4-finder -p /web-search

Change a setting:

    xfconf-query -c xfce4-finder -p /web-search -s https://www.bing.com?q=%s

Set array values:

	xfconf-query -c xfce4-finder -p /application-directories -s /usr/share/applications -s /usr/local/share/applications

The above sets the application-directories array property which is used by xfce4-finder to location application files to /usr/share/applications and /usr/local/share/applications.  You may need to update this setting if your applications directory is not included by default.
